Description: 
    An implementation of ranked sparsity methods, including 
    penalized regression methods such as the sparsity-ranked lasso, its
    non-convex alternatives,  and elastic net, as well as the sparsity-ranked
    Bayesian Information Criterion. These methods are primarily useful for 
    variable selection in the presence of prior informational asymmetry, 
    which occurs in the context of trying to perform variable selection 
    in the presence of interactions and/or polynomials. Ultimately, 
    this package attempts to facilitate dealing with cumbersome interactions 
    and polynomials while not avoiding them entirely.
